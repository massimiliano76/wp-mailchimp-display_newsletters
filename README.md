Code display

Mailchimp newsletter campaigns are also available as RSS feeds.  It's an obscure feature, but a handy one.
This code will pull the RSS feed in, parse it, then display the results on the screen.
Each newsletter appears with the date, title, excerpt.  The user can click a button to read the entire newsletter.

To use the code, you need to get the RSS feed from Mailchimp -- which is hidden a bit.
Follow the steps below to get the RSS feed for your campaign, then paste it into the code.
